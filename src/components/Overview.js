              After studying Philosophy at the University of Nottingham, I moved to Taiwan to study Mandarin for a couple of years before immersing myself in Taiwanâ€™s tech industry. I worked for ten years as a technical writer, gaining valuable work and life experience along the way. While I thoroughly enjoyed technical writing, I felt the need to learn coding to make more significant contributions and reach my full potential. After evaluating all options, I decided to return to the U.K. to focus on becoming a software developer. I am currently working part-time on a variety of projects that involve training AI models through coding, code review and enhancement, as well as training large language models. I am enthusiastic about this new career path, as it offers exciting opportunities for growth and innovation, and I am eager to apply my diverse skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
