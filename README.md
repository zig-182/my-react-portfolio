# Overview
A personal website built using React, featuring information about me, my background, and the projects I’ve worked on. It also includes details about my tech stack and provides a way to contact me.

# Important Note
My website is a work in progress. I am treating it as a learning experience, with the current goal of mastering the website’s structure, understanding how its components interact, and exploring additional features and sections. Future efforts will focus on enhancing its aesthetics.

# Goals

I have two main goals for this project:
* **Learn Frontend Technologies:** To deepen my understanding of React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **Enhance Aesthetics and Showcase Work:** To focus on the visual design and use the site as a platform to display my projects and achievements.

Before starting this project, I watched several tutorials on frontend technologies and practiced independently. After gaining a foundational understanding, I followed a tutorial on freeCodeCamp to set up a template for my personal website. I then began customising the template, which can be broadly categorised into the following areas:

* **Components**: I familiarised myself with how the components are structured to build the website and made adjustments as needed. With my experience in other frameworks such as Django and Flask, I was already familiar with the concept of how components interact with different parts of the code, which allowed me to implement several changes effectively.
* **Styling**: I added and optimised images to ensure they were responsive. I also adjusted the colours, fonts, sizes, and layout of various sections on the page. Additionally, I set up internal links and connecting buttons at the top of the page to different sections below.
* **GitHub Pages**: I plan to host my website on GitHub Pages and am currently in the process of setting this up. For now, I am reviewing the site on my local device.


# Languages
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS


# Next Steps
Currently, the CSS is embedded within the same files as the JavaScript content. Based on feedback, I am exploring a more effective approach by moving the CSS to a separate file and linking it with the relevant components. I am researching the best practices for this restructuring and also plan to host the website on GitHub Pages.
